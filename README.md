#Acodemy

Hello.
My name is Aleksandra. I'm experienced Cross-border claims adjuster with 7+ years of experience, bringing forth the ability to properly investigate a situation and resolve claims quickly in
accordance with company and regulatory guidelines. I have advanced skills communicating and working with claimants, clients, and colleagues.

At the moment I'm tired from my current work, there are no opportunities for career growth.

I decided to change something in my life and take QA classes at  Acodemy.
